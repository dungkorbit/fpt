There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of used cars using a variety of features, because it is important to know their actual market value both for buying and selling. Even though there are websites that offers this  service, their prediction method may not be the best. By using linear regression, please predict the price of the used car with the parameters  in X_dataset, with R_square = 0.77.	https://github.com/dungkorbit/fpt/blob/master/programming_exercies/exercise/car/test_data/car_1254.csv	https://github.com/dungkorbit/fpt/blob/master/programming_exercies/exercise/car/train_data/car_price.csv
